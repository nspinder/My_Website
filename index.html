          <h3 style="margin:6px 0 6px;">What Is AML?</h3>
          <p>
            Anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, encompassing global laws, regulations, and procedures, are essential for detecting and preventing the transformation of illicit funds into legitimate income. AML regulations exist to prevent the concealment of criminal profits within the financial system. Financial institutions use Know Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes to identify and mitigate potential money laundering activities. Money laundering involves three main stages: placement (depositing), layering (obscuring origins through various transactions), and integration or extraction (using the funds for large purchases or withdrawals).

            <p>AML programs are regulated at both national and international levels. A strong AML program reduces financial crime risk, supports legitimate business growth, and helps maintain trust with customers and regulators.</p>

          <h3 style="margin:6px 0 6px;">Why Are AML Regulations Important</h3>
          <p>
            AML regulations are crucial because they prevent illicit funds from entering the financial system, thereby combating terrorism financing, corruption, fraud, and other criminal activities that undermine economic stability and public trust. They achieve this by requiring financial institutions to implement controls such as customer due diligence, ongoing transaction monitoring, and reporting of suspicious activities to regulators. Compliance protects businesses from hefty fines and legal penalties, safeguards their reputation, and maintains the integrity of the global financial system.

            <summary style="cursor:pointer; color:#93c5fd;">Read more</summary>
            <p>Regulators expect robust governance, risk-based monitoring, and evidence of ongoing training and testing. Non-compliance can lead to enforcement actions, fines, and licensing issues.</p>
