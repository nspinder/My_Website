          Independent AML Consultant | CAMS Certified | Brazil/U.S. Regulatory Experience
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:6px;">
          CAMS-certified AML professional with 4+ years of experience enhancing compliance programs across Brazil, the United States, Canada, and the UK. I combine policy and program development with data-driven approachesâ€”using SQL, Python, and machine learningâ€”to improve transaction monitoring, reduce false positives, and create scalable AML solutions that support product launches and regulatory alignment.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          I partner with Legal, Product, and Engineering teams to embed risk-based controls and deliver practical training so teams can detect, investigate, and report financial crime effectively. If you need tailored AML program work, data-driven monitoring rules, or training to prepare staff (or yourself) for CAMS, I can help.

          <h3 style="margin:6px 0 6px;">What Is AML?</h3>
          <p>
            Anti-money laundering (AML) comprises laws, regulations, and procedures designed to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income. Financial institutions apply Know Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes to establish identity and risk, then use transaction monitoring and alerting to identify suspicious activity across the stages of placement, layering, and integration.

          <h3 style="margin:6px 0 6px;">Why Are AML Regulations Important</h3>
          <p>
            AML regulations prevent illicit funds from flowing through the financial system, reducing fraud, corruption, and terrorism financing. Strong compliance programs protect institutions from fines and reputational harm while supporting legitimate business growth. Effective programs include risk-based monitoring, evidence of training, and governance that demonstrate proactive management to regulators.

          <h3 style="margin:6px 0 6px;">What can I do for you?</h3>
          <p>
            I deliver cross-border AML program design and implementation, including policies, alerts tuning, sanctions and PEP screening automation, and staff training. I use analytics and machine learning when appropriate to reduce false positives while preserving detection, and I support audit readiness and remediation to maintain compliance with local and partner-bank expectations.

        <h3>Approach & Services</h3>
        <p>
          My approach focuses on customizing AML strategies to an organizationâ€™s risk profile. I prioritize policy clarity, control mapping, and operational solutions that can be embedded into product workflows. I help design KYC, EDD, and SAR workflows, prepare teams for regulatory review, and provide training that improves both production and quality metrics.

        <h3>How I Work</h3>
        <p>
          I take a collaborative, transparent approachâ€”working closely with Legal, Product, and Technology teams to identify risk, align priorities, and deploy efficient detection solutions. Each engagement begins with discovery, then moves to risk-based design, implementation, and measurement so leadership receives clear dashboards and practical recommendations.
