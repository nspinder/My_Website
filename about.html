      <p>
        I am an ambitious and results-oriented Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and financial crime compliance professional with over four years of experience supporting financial institutions and fintechs across Brazil and the United States. My expertise lies in building, enhancing, and managing AML frameworks that meet both global and local regulatory expectations. I’ve led end-to-end initiatives that strengthened AML programs—ranging from the design of risk-based policies and controls to the automation of transaction monitoring through AI and machine learning solutions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My work bridges compliance, data, and technology. I’ve successfully optimized alert systems to reduce false positives, improved case management efficiency, and collaborated with engineering teams to ensure compliance requirements are seamlessly integrated into business and product strategies. I take pride in my ability to translate complex regulatory expectations into practical, scalable solutions that help organizations grow responsibly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Certified as a CAMS (Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist), I bring a strong foundation in global AML standards, fraud prevention, and risk governance. My goal is to continue developing innovative AML strategies that leverage data analytics and automation to make compliance smarter, faster, and more proactive.
