      <p>
        CAMS-certified AML professional with 4+ years of experience enhancing compliance programs across Brazil, the United States, Canada, and the UK. I combine hands-on operational experience with data skills in SQL and Python and familiarity with machine learning to improve monitoring rules, reduce false positives, and automate screening for sanctions and PEPs. My work spans policy design, alert optimization, audit preparation, and training delivery to help organizations maintain regulatory alignment while supporting product development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in translating regulatory expectations into practical, scalable compliance solutions. I have led cross-functional projects with Legal, Product, and Engineering to embed AML controls into new product releases, delivered company-wide training programs, and managed external audits with zero medium or high-risk findings. I aim to make compliance smarter and more efficient through data-driven decision making and pragmatic implementation.

        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy exploring cultures and languages, having lived in Jordan, China, and now Brazil. These experiences shaped my global mindset and helped me develop strong communication and cross-cultural skills. Iâ€™m passionate about reading, history, sports, and travel, and I bring curiosity and adaptability into my compliance work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I speak English and Portuguese natively, with advanced Arabic and intermediate Spanish. This multilingual ability supports cross-border investigations and communication with international stakeholders.

        <h3>Capabilities</h3>
        <p>
          I support the full AML lifecycle: policy development, regulatory mapping, KYC/EDD, transaction monitoring design and tuning, sanctions screening, and SAR processes. I also deliver training and mentoring for analysts and teams, and create data-driven reporting and dashboards using SQL, Tableau, and Excel to surface trends and prioritize investigations.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background working with fintechs and banks across jurisdictions allows me to tailor programs to local law while keeping global best practices in focus, improving both compliance outcomes and operational efficiency.
