        <h3>AML Specialist – Cloudwalk, Inc. (Remote - Brazil) | Apr 2025 – Oct 2025</h3>
        <p>
          At Cloudwalk I developed and enhanced internal AML policies and procedures to align with Brazilian and U.S. regulations while coordinating with sponsor banks to ensure consistent controls. I integrated AI and machine learning models into transaction monitoring to improve detection and decrease false positives, automated sanctions, PEP and criminal-record screening during onboarding, and took primary responsibility for SAR filing and remediation processes. I also led company-wide AML training and managed external audits to sustain a clean audit record.

        <h3>Regulatory Compliance Analyst II – UKG (Remote - US) | Oct 2024 – Mar 2025</h3>
        <p>
          At UKG I reviewed and remediated AML alerts for payroll-related transactions and maintained consistently high throughput and quality in remediation efforts. I identified recurring typologies, proposed logic changes to reduce false positives, and ensured timely escalations to meet regulatory standards across multinational accounts.

        <h3>Quality Control Senior Analyst II – AML RightSource (Remote - US) | Nov 2021 – Oct 2024</h3>
        <p>
          In quality control I conducted detailed reviews of AML alerts, KYC/EDD files, SAR workflows, and correspondent banking cases. I consistently ranked among the top analysts for production and quality, led training and mentoring for more than 50 analysts, and helped drive measurable improvements in productivity and accuracy across the team. I also served as a subject matter expert on complex, high-risk investigations.
