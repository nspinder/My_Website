        <h3>AML Specialist – Cloudwalk, Inc. (Remote - Brazil) | Apr 2025 – Oct 2025</h3>
        <p>
          As an AML Specialist at Cloudwalk, I developed and enhanced the company’s internal AML policies and procedures, ensuring compliance with both Brazilian and U.S. regulatory requirements. I monitored complex financial transactions for indicators of money laundering, fraud, or terrorist financing, and utilized AI and machine learning to strengthen detection and reporting efficiency. I also implemented automated programs to identify sanctioned individuals, politically exposed persons (PEPs), and customers with criminal records during onboarding and ongoing monitoring. In this role, I managed external AML/BSA and fraud audits, maintaining a spotless compliance record through proactive risk mitigation and timely reporting. Additionally, I led company-wide AML training initiatives, achieving full participation, and collaborated closely with Legal, Product, Operations, and Technology teams to embed compliance processes into product launches and strategic projects.
